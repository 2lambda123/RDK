This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Troubleshooting GitHub Actions Run Failure

If the GitHub Actions run fails, follow the steps below to troubleshoot and fix the failure:
1. Analyze Error Logs
2. Identify the Cause of the Failure
3. Steps to Fix Common Issues

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

### Analyzing Error Logs and Identifying the Cause

#### Accessing GitHub Actions Run Logs

To access the GitHub Actions run logs and look for error messages and details, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the specific workflow run that failed.
3. View the log details to identify error messages, timestamps, and relevant details.
To analyze the error logs and identify the cause of the GitHub Actions run failure, follow the steps below:
1. Access the GitHub Actions run logs and look for error messages, timestamps, and relevant details.
2. Look for specific error codes or descriptions that can help pinpoint the cause of the failure.
3. Pay attention to the timing of the failure and any relevant changes made prior to the failure.
   - Solution: Perform the required configuration changes in the GitHub Actions workflow file to address the issue.
